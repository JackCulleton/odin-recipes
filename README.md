# Odin Recipes

This is my first project from **The Odin Project Foundations course**.  
Itâ€™s a basic recipe website built using only **HTML** to practice the following skills:

- Creating and structuring an HTML project  
- Using headings, paragraphs, lists, and links  
- Adding and displaying images  
- Working with relative and absolute paths  
- Using Git for version control and GitHub for hosting  

By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated my ability to build a simple, multi-page website and manage it with Git.
